                <h3>Who is the Turbulent INTP (INTP-T)?</h3>
                <h5>‣ Author: Umesi ‣ Original Link: <a
                        href="https://personalityhunt.com/who-is-the-turbulent-intp-intp-t/" target="_blank"

                <p>When it comes to logic and analysis, it probably does not get better than the INTP. However, not all
                    INTPs
                    are the same. Just like any other type, there’s the INTP-T and the INTP-A.</p>
                <p>Here, we’ll focus more on the INTP-T. So, who is an INTP-T and what can you expect from this
                    personality type?</p>
                <h3>Who is an INTP-T?</h3>
                <p>This is the turbulent INTP. They take a more withdrawn stance when dealing with people. They are also
                    laidback in
                    life and might struggle with asserting themselves.</p>
                <p>This might show in their decision making and possibly the way they react to situations around them.
                    You should know
                    that the INTP-T and the INTP-A have the same cognitive functions.</p>
                <p>The difference is simply in their approach to life.</p>
                <h3>What are INTP-Ts Like?</h3>
                <h4>1. Super Super Introverts</h4>
                <p>We already knew that the INTPs were super introverts. However, INTP-T possibly pushes it as far as
                    they can go.</p>
                <p>INTPs are usually known to come out of their shell when something excites them or when they are being
                    prodded by the
                    ENTP.</p>
                <p>However, INTP-T will seek solace even in these times. Their alone time is quite important to them.
                    Thus, INTP-T will
                    only join a conversation that really matters to them.</p>
                <p>Even then, they might spend most of their time listening to people’s opinions.</p>
                <h4>2. Less Decisive</h4>
                <p>It’s hard to be an INTP. They lead with introverted thinking (Ti). Their second function is
                    extroverted intuition
                    (Ne). This means that the INTP sees multiple possibilities and spends a lot of time filtering and
                    testing these
                    possibilities.</p>
                <p>They want to find the most rational option. This definitely does not help the decision-making
                    process. Turbulent
                    INTPs face an even bigger problem.</p>
                <p>They are more afraid of making mistakes. Thus, they will mull over the loopholes and analyze the
                    decision more
                    critically.</p>
                <p>INTP-Ts might seem quite slow to reach a conclusion. They are similar to the INTJ-T in this regard.
                </p>
                <h4>3. A Craving to be Better</h4>
                <p>Most turbulent personalities want to do better. This is also evident with the INTP-T. Because they
                    spend a lot of
                    time thinking, they know their flaws and vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p>Thus, INTP-T will work twice as hard to develop themselves. While this clearly has some benefits, it
                    also has its
                    drawbacks.</p>
                <p>The turbulent INTP will often become overwhelmed and negative when they do not achieve these goals.
                </p>
                <h4>4. INTP-T and Enneagram Types</h4>
                <p>INTP-Ts are more likely to be <a
                        href="https://personalityhunt.com/enneagram-type-5-the-investigator/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener">type 5s</a> than any other type. This is often backed up
                    with <a href="https://personalityhunt.com/enneagram-type-6-the-loyal-skeptic/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener">type 6 </a>as a wing. Thus, <a
                        href="https://personalityhunt.com/intp-5w6-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener">INTP
                        5w6s</a> will usually be INTP-Ts.</p>
                <p>While this is true, INTP-Ts can also be <a
                        href="https://personalityhunt.com/intp-5w4-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener">5w4s</a> and <a
                        href="https://personalityhunt.com/intp-4w5-the-complete-guide/" data-type="URL"
                        data-id="https://personalityhunt.com/intp-4w5-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener">4w5s</a>.</p>
                <h4>5. Consistency</h4>
                <p>The need to be perfect and to cover all loopholes can be a problem for this personality type. This
                    can lead to a slow
                    decision-making process. It can also make them change their mind repeatedly.</p>
                <p>Because their mind keeps on analyzing the pros and cons, committing to a plan will be difficult. To
                    them, this might
                    seem unintentional. To people around them, this makes them look inconsistent and unreliable.</p>
                <h4>6. Dealing with Emotions</h4>
                <p>INTPs are thinkers. However, this does not mean that they have no feelings. In fact, the INTP-T shows
                    how deep the
                    emotions of an INTP can run.</p>
                <p>INTP-Ts can find people’s actions to be deeply upsetting. Thus, it is more difficult for them to move
                    on from
                    negative interactions. When compared with the assertive INTP, they are more likely to build
                    resentment.</p>
                <p>Being more emotional also has its perks. INTP-Ts can better understand the emotions of those around
                    them. This makes
                    them similar to the INFP.</p>
                <h4>7. Team Players</h4>
                <p>INTPs are independent types. However, INTP-Ts still want a bit of reassurance. This can come in form
                    of people’s
                    opinions. This has some benefits and drawbacks.</p>
                <p>One of the obvious benefits is that this makes them well-rounded and good team players. However, they
                    might become
                    too focused on these reassurances. This might make them build their confidence around people’s
                    approval.</p>
                <p>That’s definitely not the right way to go.</p>
                <h3>INTP-T and Dating</h3>
                <p>INTPs look for specific things when they are in a relationship. Knowing these things will help you
                    strengthen your
                    relationship with your partner. This is true of turbulent INTPs.</p>
                <p>Here are some of the most common needs of the INTP-T in romantic relationships.</p>
                <h4>1. They Want a Smart Partner</h4>
                <p>Top of the list is the brilliance of their partners. This does not necessarily mean academic smart.
                    They just want
                    their partners to have common sense.</p>
                <p>They also want them to be good at what they do. INTP-Ts want to learn from their partners. If they
                    feel their partner
                    is not smart enough, they can leave the relationship.</p>
                <p>Clearly, INTP-Ts are <a href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/sapiosexual-identity-and-signs"
                        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sapiosexuals.</a></p>
                <h4>2. Change and Development</h4>
                <p>INTP-Ts are still perceivers. This means they enjoy spontaneous actions and constant change. They
                    also feel that this
                    is really the only way their relationship can make progress.</p>
                <p>So, if you are someone who find it difficult to make changes or find development to be quite
                    stressful, you might
                    struggle with the INTP-T.</p>
                <h4>3. Quality Time</h4>
                <p>INTP-Ts do not talk much. However, <a
                        href="https://personalityhunt.com/love-languages-quality-time-complete-guide/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener">quality time</a> with their partners matters a lot to them. They want
                    to feel
                    connected to their partner.</p>
                <p>Spending time alone with them is enough to give them this connection. Of course, everyone has their
                    own definition of
                    quality time.</p>
                <p>Find out what your partner enjoys and give them that in abundance.</p>
                <h4>4. INTP-T and Compatibility</h4>
                <p>The natural partners of the INTP-T are the ESTJ-A and the ENTJ-A. While this is true, the
                    relationship between any
                    two types is not a given.</p>
                <p>Partners need to put in the work to make sure the relationship succeeds.</p>
                <h3>Struggles you will face while Dating an INTP-T</h3>
                <h4>1. Alone Time</h4>
                <p>If you are a super extrovert, this is where you might struggle. INTP-Ts like their alone time and
                    they will demand
                    you give them this time.</p>
                <p>You just might not understand why your partner doesn’t want to go to that event with you. You might
                    even feel they no
                    longer love you. However, alone time is necessary for them to recharge.</p>
                <p>To make sure their social levels stay up, try to socialize with them alone or with few people.</p>
                <h4>2. Blunt</h4>
                <p>INTPs can be quite blunt. This does not get any better with INTP-Ts. They prefer this style of
                    communication and want
                    people to be direct with them.</p>
                <p>If you are a feeler type or someone more sensitive, this might be difficult to understand. However,
                    with enough
                    communication, both parties can reach some form of common ground.</p>
                <h3>INTP-T and the Workplace</h3>
                <p>INTP-Ts excel in a workplace that is flexible and innovative. They love to solve problems and want to
                    work with
                    like-minded people.</p>
                <p>While this is true, placing them in positions that requires making quick decisions might not be the
                    best option.
                    INTP-Ts do best when they are the brain box of an organization.</p>
                <p>To get the best of them, make sure that INTP-Ts are given a creative role that is flexible.</p>

                <h2>INTP 5w4 (The Complete Guide)</h2>
                <h5>‣ Author: Umesi ‣ Original Link: <a href="https://personalityhunt.com/intp-5w4-the-complete-guide/"

                <p>INTPs are the logicians or thinkers of the MBTI typology. They are great problem solvers with great
                    curiosity about
                    the world around them. When the MBTI typology is compared with enneagrams, a significant number <a
                        href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2016/01/mbti-and-the-enneagram-2/8/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">identifies as an INTP 5w4</a>.</p>
                <p>If you are friends or partners with an INTP 5w4, you can agree that they are quite intriguing. If you
                    are having
                    problems getting to know them better, you might learn a thing or two from this article.</p>
                <h3>What Would an INTP 5w4 Look Like?</h3>
                <p>INTP 5w4 are very sufficient people. They pride themselves on being competent and self-sufficient.
                    They thrive to
                    achieve this by gathering as much knowledge as they can.</p>
                <p>Thus, INTP 5w4 tries to avoid relying too much on others for anything. They are on a constant quest
                    to discover as
                    much as they can from the world and their various projects.</p>
                <p>INTP 5w4 will look very much like your typical INTP for various reasons. First, INTPs are mostly
                    typed as <a href="https://personalityhunt.com/enneagram-type-5-the-investigator/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener">enneagram 5s</a>.</p>
                <p>This matches some of the core and most important traits of the INTP such as alone time and being
                    great thinkers.
                    However, because their wing is <a
                        href="https://personalityhunt.com/enneagram-type-4-the-individualist/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener">type 4</a>, some of the core traits of the INTP might also be altered.
                </p>
                <p>However, the degree to which this happens will often depend on the strength of their wings. For an <a
                        href="https://personalityhunt.com/enneagram-5-wing-4-5w4-the-unique-investigator/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-depth description of enneagram 5w4</a>, you can
                    click that link.</p>
                <h3>What is the Basic Desire of the INTP 5w4?</h3>
                <p>The basic fear of the INTP 5w4 is to become self-sufficient and significant. They want to stand out
                    for what they
                    know and can do. Thus, accumulating knowledge is simply a good place to start.</p>
                <p>However, they also want to make sure they are unique and different from others.</p>
                <h3>What is the Basic Fear of the INTP 5w4?</h3>
                <p>The basic fear of the INTP 5w4 is becoming incompetent. They are scared of not being self-sufficient
                    and having to
                    rely on others for their needs.</p>
                <h3>How 5w4 changes the Natural Tendencies of the INTP</h3>
                <p>As earlier stated, a lot of things about the INTP will stay the same if they are a type 5. However,
                    because of their
                    wing, you can expect some of these changes.</p>
                <h4>1. Interest in Art or Music</h4>
                <p>INTP 5w4 will have an interest in arts or music. Depending on their wing, this might just be a slight
                    interest or a
                    major one.</p>
                <p>Thus, INTPs might learn to play an instrument or try drawing. This can be a major thing or a side
                    interest for them.
                </p>
                <h4>2. More Sensitive</h4>
                <p>INTP 5w4s will often have a more sensitive side. Depending on their wing, this can be a slight change
                    or a
                    significant one.</p>
                <p>Their sensitive side will be more obvious to those around them. Type 5s are generally known to be
                    detached and often
                    aloof. However, this changes slightly for this type.</p>
                <p>This leads to a more developed extroverted feeling function for the INTP.</p>
                <p>However, INTPs are still INTPs. Thus, they will always put rational thinking first.</p>
                <h4>3. More inclined to learn on their own</h4>
                <p>Type 5s and INTP share one thing in common. They want to keep learning. Thus, this is heightened when
                    both types are
                    placed side by side.</p>
                <p>Because type 5 wants to be self-sufficient and their wing wants to be independent, INTP 5w4 will
                    often choose to
                    learn things by themselves.</p>
                <p>This might see them dive into research projects on their own and make tremendous progress. Some of
                    the best
                    self-taught professionals today are INTP 5w4s.</p>
                <p>By doing this, they further prove to themselves that they are independent.</p>
                <h4>4. Outward Show of Affection</h4>
                <p>Let’s be clear. INTPs are still INTPs. Thus, outward show of love will not be easy for them. However,
                    INTP 5w4s are
                    going to be better at this.</p>
                <p>They will find a form of outlet to express this better. This might be through writing. INTP 5w4s
                    often make great
                    poets.</p>
                <p>No matter the outlet, their partners will be shown more outward expression of love.</p>
                <h4>5. More Isolated</h4>
                <p>When compared with INTP 5w6, INTP 5w4s will be much more isolated. While type 6 seems to be more
                    neutral, type 5 and
                    type 4 are usually introverts.</p>
                <p>Thus, INTP 5w4s really enjoy their alone time. They do not look forward to anyone messing with it.
                    They won’t even
                    let you.</p>
                <h3>New Weaknesses of the INTP 5w4</h3>
                <h4>1. More Detached</h4>
                <p>As earlier stated, this type will be more introverted. Thus, they will be more detached and separated
                    from others.
                </p>
                <p>Their hobbies or projects are going to take center stage in their life. If not properly balanced,
                    this can put a
                    strain on their relationship with loved ones.</p>
                <h4>2. Extremely Stubborn</h4>
                <p>INTP 5w4s will be a lot more stubborn than typical INTPs. 5w4s brings with it some core values that
                    they live by.</p>
                <p>Thus, INTP 5w4 will hold on to those values and resist any attempt to sway them. While this makes
                    them less likely to
                    be people-pleasers, it can also hold them back in many ways.</p>
                <p>It might also make them believe that their point of view is always the right one.</p>
                <h4>3. More Subjective</h4>
                <p>INTPs are known to be rational thinkers. However, because of their wing, INTP 5w4s are going to look
                    more subjective
                    than normal INTPs.</p>
                <p>They might hold certain strong sentiments and refuse to let go of them even when proved wrong.
                    Depending on the
                    strength of their wing, this might be a big part of them or a slight alteration.</p>
