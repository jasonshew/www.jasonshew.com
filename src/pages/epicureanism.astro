                <h2>On Epicureanism</h2>
                <p>I identify as a believer in Epicureanism. Epicureanism is a philosophical system founded by the
                    ancient Greek
                    philosopher Epicurus around 307 BCE. It emphasizes the pursuit of pleasure and happiness as the
                    highest good in
                    life, but it’s important to understand that this “pleasure” is not about indulgence in physical or
                    sensual
                    pleasures, but rather about achieving a state of tranquility and freedom from pain, both physical
                    and mental. It’s
                    NOT a synonym of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism" target="_blank"

                <h3>Key Concepts of Epicureanism:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Pleasure as the Ultimate Goal:</strong><br>
                        Epicurus believed that the purpose of life is to achieve ataraxia (peace of mind) and aponia
                        (absence of pain).
                        True pleasure is found in the absence of distress and fear, particularly the fear of death and
                        the gods.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Moderation and Simple Pleasures:</strong><br>
                        Epicureans advocate for a simple life, where basic needs are met, and excessive desires are
                        avoided. They argue
                        that mental pleasures, such as friendship and intellectual pursuits, are superior to physical
                        pleasures, which
                        are often fleeting and can lead to pain if indulged excessively.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>The Role of Knowledge:</strong><br>
                        Epicurus emphasized the importance of knowledge and understanding to eliminate fears, especially
                        those related
                        to death and the afterlife. He taught that the universe operates according to natural laws, and
                        that the soul
                        does not survive after death, thus there is no need to fear the afterlife.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>The Gods:</strong><br>
                        While Epicureans did not deny the existence of gods, they believed that gods are not concerned
                        with human
                        affairs. Therefore, the gods should not be feared, as they do not interfere in the world.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Ethical Living:</strong><br>
                        Epicureanism promotes a life of ethical conduct where actions are chosen based on their
                        potential to bring
                        long-term happiness and avoid pain. This includes cultivating friendships, which Epicurus saw as
                        essential to a
                        happy life.</li><br>
                </ol>
                <h3>Modern Interpretation:</h3>
                <p>In modern usage, the term “Epicurean” is often associated with a love of fine food and drink, but
                    this is a
                    simplification. True Epicureanism is about finding deep contentment and avoiding suffering through
                    knowledge,
                    moderation, and the cultivation of meaningful relationships.</p>
